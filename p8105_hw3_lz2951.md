# Problem 1

## Dataset description

First, import dataset.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each row is a product
from an order and each column is a variable. The 15 variables are:
order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. Take the
observation 1, 49302, 1, 1, 112108, train, 4, 4, 10, 9, Bulgarian
Yogurt, 120, 16, yogurt, dairy eggs as an example, it shows a Bulgarian
Yogurt with product id 49302 bought at 10 o’clock of the 4th day of the
week by a user with user id 112108. This product purchase belongs to the
order with order id 1 and order sequence order 4, in which the order of
this product to be added to the cart is 1. It has been 9 days since the
last order. The yogurt has been ordered by the user in the past, and
belongs to the aisle yogurt with aisle id 120 and department dairy eggs
with department id 16. The evaluation set this order belongs in is
train.

## Some key questions about dataset

- How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
  from?

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(orders_from_aisle = n()) |>
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 134

There are 134 aisles.

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(orders_from_aisle = n()) |>
  mutate(
    aisle_rank_by_order = min_rank(desc(orders_from_aisle))
  ) |>
  filter(aisle_rank_by_order < 2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   aisle            orders_from_aisle aisle_rank_by_order
    ##   <chr>                        <int>               <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables            150609                   1

The aisle with the most items are fresh vegetables.

- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(orders_from_aisle = n()) |>
  filter(orders_from_aisle > 10000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(aisle, desc(orders_from_aisle)), y = orders_from_aisle)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "aisle", y = "orders belonging to certain aisle")
```

![](p8105_hw3_lz2951_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |>
  summarize(number_of_orders = n()) |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  mutate(
    product_rank_in_aisle = min_rank(desc(number_of_orders))
  ) |>
  filter(product_rank_in_aisle < 4) |>
  arrange(aisle, product_rank_in_aisle) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(order_dow, product_name) |>
  summarize(mean_hour_of_the_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour_of_the_day
  ) |>
  rename(
    mean_hour_of_Sunday = 2,
    mean_hour_of_Monday = 3,
    mean_hour_of_Tuesday = 4,
    mean_hour_of_Wednesday = 5,
    mean_hour_of_Thusday = 6,
    mean_hour_of_Friday = 7,
    mena_hour_of_Saturday = 8
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

# Problem 2

## Data cleaning

First, import dataset.

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Check and clean the variable names:

``` r
colnames(brfss_smart2010)
```

    ##  [1] "Year"                       "Locationabbr"              
    ##  [3] "Locationdesc"               "Class"                     
    ##  [5] "Topic"                      "Question"                  
    ##  [7] "Response"                   "Sample_Size"               
    ##  [9] "Data_value"                 "Confidence_limit_Low"      
    ## [11] "Confidence_limit_High"      "Display_order"             
    ## [13] "Data_value_unit"            "Data_value_type"           
    ## [15] "Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol" "Data_Value_Footnote"       
    ## [17] "DataSource"                 "ClassId"                   
    ## [19] "TopicId"                    "LocationID"                
    ## [21] "QuestionID"                 "RESPID"                    
    ## [23] "GeoLocation"

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010)
```

Focus on the “Overall Health” topic.

``` r
brfss_smart2010 |>
  group_by(topic) |>
  summarize(n_topic = n()) |>
  filter(topic == "Overall Health")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##   topic          n_topic
    ##   <chr>            <int>
    ## 1 Overall Health   10625

``` r
brfss_smart2010_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010 |>
    filter(topic == "Overall Health")
```

Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”:

``` r
brfss_smart2010_overall_health |>
  group_by(response) |>
  summarize(n_response = n())
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##   response  n_response
    ##   <chr>          <int>
    ## 1 Excellent       2125
    ## 2 Fair            2125
    ## 3 Good            2125
    ## 4 Poor            2125
    ## 5 Very good       2125

Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent”:

``` r
brfss_smart2010_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010_overall_health |>
    mutate(response = factor(brfss_smart2010_overall_health$response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

## Some questions about dataset

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
brfss_smart2010_overall_health |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr, locationdesc) |>
  summarize(n_location = n()) |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarize(n_location_in_state = n()) |>
  filter(n_location_in_state >= 7, year %in% c(2002, 2010)) |>
  arrange(year) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.
